Compile xrit2pic for Windows.
This readme describes how to compile xrit2pic for Windows:
. non-gui mode
. gui mode (needs gtk libraries)

Note that xrit2pic gui mode has a -nongui option, but then you need the 
graphical gtk environment (libraries) anyway. 
Compilation for non-gui doesn't need these libraries.


Non-gui (commandline):
. You need gcc and make for Windows.

With gui:
. You need gcc and make for Windows, and gtk for windows.


There are 2 special dynamically linked libraries necessary: 
for jpeg and for wavelet decompression.

You can use the precompiled jpeg library, or compile it yourself.

You need the precompiled wavelet library. 
(Source code of Wavelet is only available via Eumetsat.)

1. For both non-gui and gui mode; use pre-compiled decompress libs

To compile you need (see website: http://www.alblas.demon.nl/wsat/software)
. xrit2pic_src.zip 
. decompr_winlnlib.zip


Use command shell to do the compile.
For unzipping you may also use winzip.

. Create a directory, put the 2 zip files into this dir.
. Unzip (or use winzip):
    unzip xrit2pic_src.zip
    unzip decompr_winlnlib.zip

You should now have the following directories:
xrit/wvt
jpeg812


Now choose if you want no_gui or gui mode.

NOTE: Don't switch compilation from one mode to the other without doing a clean:

make -f xritwin.mk clean

1.1. Compile Non-gui mode.

Unpack:
make -f xritwin.mk unpack_nogui

Compile:
make -f xritwin.mk comp_nogui

The result xrit2pic.exe is in the xrit directory. 


1.2. Compile Gui-mode.
Unpack:
make -f xritwin.mk unpack_gui

Compile:
make -f xritwin.mk comp_gui

The result xrit2pic.exe is in the xrit directory. 

1.3. Installation.
In addition you need dll's from:
setup_decompr.exe
This is a self-extracting installation.

Easiest is to install xrit2pic.exe together with the dll's 
from setup_decompr.exe into 1 directory.
