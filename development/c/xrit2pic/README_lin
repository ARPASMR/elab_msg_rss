Compile xrit2pic for Linux.
This readme describes how to compile xrit2pic for Linux:
. non-gui mode
. gui mode (needs gtk libraries)

Note that xrit2pic gui mode has a -nongui option, but then you need the 
graphical gtk environment (libraries) anyway. 
Compilation for non-gui doesn't need these libraries.

Non-gui (commandline):
. You need gcc and make for Linux (should be available with any distribution).

With gui:
. You need gcc and make for Linux, and gtk for Linux (should be available with any distribution)..


There are 2 special dynamically linked libraries necessary: 
for jpeg and for wavelet decompression.

You can use the precompiled jpeg library, or compile it yourself.

You need the precompiled wavelet library. 
(Source code of Wavelet is only available via Eumetsat.)

1. For both non-gui and gui mode; use pre-compiled decompress libs

To compile you need (see website: http://www.alblas.demon.nl/wsat/software)
. xrit2pic_src.zip 
. decompr.tar.gz (the same used for runtime)


. Create a directory, put the zip file into this dir.
. Unzip:
    unzip xrit2pic_src.zip

You should now have the following directories:
xrit/wvt
jpeg812


Now choose if you want no_gui or gui mode.

NOTE: Don't switch compilation from one mode to the other without doing a clean:

make -f xritlin.mk clean

1.1. Compile Non-gui mode.

Unpack:
make -f xritlin.mk unpack_nogui

Compile:
make -f xritlin.mk comp_nogui

The executable xrit2pic is in the xrit directory. 


1.2. Compile Gui-mode.
Unpack:
make -f xritlin.mk unpack_gui

Compile:
make -f xritlin.mk comp_gui

The executable xrit2pic is in the xrit directory.
